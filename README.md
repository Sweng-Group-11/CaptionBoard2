### Purpose of the system 
```
The purpose of the system is to allow clients to outsource captions via the freelance community, and then pick the perfect captions for their content.  A client can produce a storyboard of up to n images (or illustrations) with a timer on each image. The total time will last no longer than m seconds. The client also provides a relevant description or theme for each item in the storyboard. This description will help the freelancers better understand the message the client wants to get across.  Freelancers should be able to view these storyboards and input/write captions for each image.  The client can then choose what they believe to be the best captions for their storyboard. The winning freelancers will receive incentives to keep the app alive and to encourage the community to take part in captioning.
